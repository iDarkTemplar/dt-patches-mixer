dt-patches-mixer is a script for combining parts of multiple git repositories into one.

It's primary use is to combine patches for Gentoo packages from multiple sources.

How to use it for mixing patches:
	1) create empty directory, default config suggests /var/lib/dt-patches-mixer
		if directory /etc/portage/patches is empty or doesn't exist, it may be used, and steps 2 and 3 skipped
	2) backup portage patches directory if it exists, currently it's /etc/portage/patches
	3) if dt-patches-mixer directory isn't set to point to portage patches directory, make a symlink like:
		ln -sv /var/lib/dt-patches-mixer /etc/portage/patches
	4) run dt-patches-mixer manually, or do a portage synchronization of postsync hook is installed
